## Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project (FDA-Project)

This repository contains a project work for implementing a regression on a data set.

### Project requirements

Perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset. The goal is to;

- accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
  1. using simple linear regression on the data set.
  
  2. An explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
  
***

### Methodology

- Importing the data set

- Explore the data set

- pre-process and cleanse the data set

- Perform Analysis

***

### Analysis

The break down of the analysis is as follows:

- `Simple Linear Regression` using _**Numpy**_

- `Simple Linear Regression` using _**Scikit-Learn**_

- Advanced processing with _**Scikit-Learn**_, implementing `Automatic Outlier Detection` using `Isolation Forest` method

- `Simple Linear Regression` using _**Statsmodel**_

- `Polynomial Regression` using _**Scikit-Learn**_

### To run the Jupyter Notebook

Download and Install Anaconda's latest release from it's official and licensed source. The anaconda package includes the python code and the packages (libraries) needed for the computation and visualisation of the contetnts of the `power-production.ipynb` file.

1. Click on **`Code`** icon on the upper right corner and copy the `link` under `HTTPS`

2. Open the `CLI` or `cmd` on the machine navigate to the required directory insert `$ git clone` `link of the repository`

3. Insert `$ jupyter notebook`

4. A web browser is automatically initiated, where you can see the file `power-production.ipynb`
